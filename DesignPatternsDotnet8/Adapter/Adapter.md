## Simple Explanation
Imagine you have an old device that uses a two-prong plug, 
but all the power outlets in your house are now three-prong. 
Instead of buying a new device, you can use an adapter that fits into the three-prong outlet
but accepts the two-prong plug. This adapter allows the old device to work with the new outlet.
Similarly, in software, the Adapter pattern allows you to integrate classes with incompatible 
interfaces without changing their code.
